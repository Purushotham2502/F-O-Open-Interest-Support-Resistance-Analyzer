F&O Open Interest Support & Resistance Analyzer

## Overview
A Python tool and local web service that identifies support and resistance levels for F&O stocks using open interest data, with automated token management and GUI launcher.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Fyers API account (create an “App” under your Fyers developer dashboard)
  - Note your **App ID** and **App Secret**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

APP_ID = "your_app_id"
APP_SECRET = "your_app_secret"
REDIRECT_URI = what you set during your Fyers API app creation

## First-Run Authentication
1. Run the auth flow:
python authcode.py

2. Your default browser will open the Fyers login/consent page.  
3. After approving, copy the **auth code** from the redirected URL.  
4. Paste the auth code into the terminal prompt.  
5. `authcode.py` will exchange it for access and refresh tokens and save them in `fyers_tokens.json`.

## Usage
1. Prepare `stock_list.xlsx` with symbols and parameters.
2. Launch the tool via GUI:

3. If your token is expired, the terminal will prompt again for the auth code.
4. After successful auth, the local web interface will open automatically  showing a table of stocks nearest support/resistance based on open interest.

# Chrome Browser Configuration for Authentication

If you want the app to open Chrome with a specific user profile, update the following paths in the code (e.g., `authcode.py`):

- `chrome_path`: Full path to your Chrome executable (default on Windows: `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`)
- `profile_path`: Path to your Chrome user data folder (usually under `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data`)

Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual Windows username.

If unsure, you can comment these lines out and the app will open authorization URL in the default web browser automatically.



## Output
- `stocks_near_intraday_support_resistance.xlsx`: Excel report of support/resistance levels.
- Local web dashboard with interactive table.

## Notes
- Keep `fyers_tokens.json` and your API credentials secure.
- For any issues, delete `fyers_tokens.json` and rerun `authcode.py` to reauthenticate.
